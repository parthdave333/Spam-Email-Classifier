# Spam Email Classifier

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify emails into "spam" or "not spam" categories. Using a logistic regression model, the solution processes text data to ensure accurate and reliable predictions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and data cleaning.
- **Feature Extraction**: Leveraging TF-IDF vectorization for converting email text into numerical data.
- **Modeling**: Training a logistic regression classifier for binary classification.
- **Evaluation**: Measuring the model's performance through accuracy metrics.

## Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/parthdave333/spam-email-classifier.git


2. Navigate to the project directory and open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
      jupyter notebook SPAM_MAIL.ipynb

   
3. Run the cells step-by-step to train and test the model.
   
## Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled email messages categorized as spam or ham (not spam). Ensure the dataset is loaded correctly before running the notebook.

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and other relevant metrics, showcasing its efficiency in detecting spam emails.

## Future Improvements
Implementing more complex models such as ensemble methods.
Exploring hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.
Extending the model to include email metadata for richer features.
